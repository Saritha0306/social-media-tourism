## Problem Statement

An aviation company that provides domestic as well as international trips to the customers now wants to apply atargeted approach instead of reaching out to each of the customers. This time they want to do it digitally instead of tele calling. Hence they have collaborated with a social networking platform, so they can learn the digital and social behaviour of the customers and provide the digital advertisement on the userpage of the targeted customerswho have a high propensity to take up the product.

Below is the data dictionary of the dataset.
